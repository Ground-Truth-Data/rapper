/**
 * SIDE CARD — the card that sits in the gutter beside the phone, and becomes
 * a centred card over the app when there is no phone to sit beside.
 *
 * ONE COMPONENT, BOTH STATES. The desktop/mobile split is not the caller's
 * problem: a caller has a card's worth of content and this decides where it
 * goes. Splitting it was the bug — every caller then re-derived "is there a
 * phone" from a media query, and a media query is the wrong question (debug
 * routes are wide with no frame, and the frame mounts after the page does).
 *
 * THREE PLACEMENTS, ONE RULE. Beside the phone when the gutter is at least
 * MIN_LANE_REM wide; floating over the phone screen when there is a frame but
 * the gutter is narrower than that — a card squeezed to a column of five-word
 * lines is unreadable, and the phone is the one box on the page guaranteed
 * to be wide enough; centred in the viewport when there is no phone at all,
 * like every other Get Cache popover. Nothing slides off an edge.
 *
 * IT ESCAPES TO <body> ON MOUNT, and must. The phone rig is drawn with a
 * transform, and a transformed ancestor becomes the containing block for
 * `position: fixed` — so a card rendered inside the rig measures its `left`
 * from the PHONE's edge and lands on top of it. This is not an optional extra
 * a caller could bolt on: a side card that has not escaped is a card over the
 * phone. It lived in <EphemeralDock> behind a dev gate, which is why every
 * public attempt at this landed in the wrong place.
 *
 * <EphemeralCard> and <EphemeralDock> are this card with a dev gate and a
 * content portal. Fix the box here and all three move.
