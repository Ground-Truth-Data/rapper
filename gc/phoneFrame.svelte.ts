/**
 * THE PHONE FRAME, AS A FACT ANY COMPONENT CAN ASK FOR.
 *
 * Two things depend on it and both used to guess: a side card needs to know
 * whether there is a gutter to sit in and how wide it is, and the lane needs
 * the frame's measured width. Both were answered with a media query and a
 * mount-time querySelector — which is wrong twice over. The frame is drawn by
 * the (getcache) layout, so at a page component's onMount it may not exist
 * yet; and the layout's own rule is route-dependent (debug routes opt out), so
 * a media query can say "wide" on a page that has no frame.
 *
 * So: watch the DOM for the frame, publish its box while it is there, and
 * report it — `null` when there is no frame. One observer, one answer, every
 * caller, re-reported on every resize.

	 * A caller waiting for its first answer then waited forever: SideCard stayed
