/**
 * tierRoutes.ts — WHERE THIS PAGE LIVES UNDER THE OTHER TIER.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS DELETES
 * The pill used to take a fixed `otherPath` prop — `"/"` on ReTreever, and
 * `VITE_OTHER_MOUNT` = `"/who"` on rapper. Both are BUILD-TIME constants, so
 * whatever page you were on, the pill sent you to the same one. Standing on
 * /what and switching tiers landed you on /who; standing on /offline landed
 * you on the search page. The switch claimed to be "this page, other server"
 * and was actually "some page, other server".
 *
 * WHY A CONSTANT COULD NEVER WORK. `define` substitutes text once, when the
 * bundle is built — before any URL exists. "Which page am I on" is only
 * knowable when a request is answered. The destination was being read from a
 * layer that cannot hold the fact. So it moves to render time: the live
 * pathname goes in, the other tier's pathname comes out.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A MAP AND NOT A PASSTHROUGH
 * The two tiers do not serve the same routes and never will. ReTreever serves
 * /who and /what from one dynamic route; a rapper install carries ONE child,
 * mounted at "/". Carrying the path across verbatim was MEASURED landing on a
 * 404 (see rapper/vite.config.ts). So each parent declares the translation for
 * the routes IT serves, and anything unlisted falls back to the other tier's
 * home — a working page beats a dead pill.
 *
 * WHY THE MAP IS PASSED IN AND NOT WRITTEN HERE
 * This file names no tier, no host, no port and no repo, exactly as ParentPill
 * does. The mapping is a fact about which parent mounted which child, and only
 * the mounting parent knows it — a child that wrote it down would be naming a
 * parent, which noParentNames.test.ts fails. Each parent hands its own table
 * to SharedNav; a child cloned alone hands none and gets no pill.

 *
 * WHY `otherHome` IS A PARAMETER AND NOT "/".
 * "/" is where a server answers, not necessarily where its WORK is. rapper
 * serves its one child at "/", so "/" is right for it. ReTreever serves a
 * marketing homepage at "/" and its actual search at /who, so falling back to
 * "/" dropped you on a landing page — a working page, but not the one you were

 * Only the tier being LINKED TO knows where its useful landing route is, so
 * the caller passes it; omitted, this degrades to the old "/" behaviour.

/**
 * WHAT THE OTHER TIER ACTUALLY SERVES — asked, not asserted.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS DELETES
 * `servesOtherSide` above answers from a TABLE, and a table can only describe
 * a tier in general. A rapper install carries exactly ONE child, chosen at
 * install time, so the running server serves a strict SUBSET of what the table
 * lists. MEASURED 27 Aug 2026: the table declared /map, /map/debug, /offline
 * and /offline/debug, the pill rendered live links for all four, and the rapper
 * on :5174 — a who_what install — answered every one of them with a 404.
 *
 * The table was not wrong. It was answering a different question. "Which of my
 * routes COULD map across" is a fact about the source; "does the thing on the
 * other end have this page" is a fact about a process that is running right
 * now, and no build-time artifact can hold it. Adding rows, or hand-syncing a
 * second table against whichever child is installed, is the same duplication
 * one layer along — it drifts the first time somebody swaps the child.
 *
 * So this asks. HEAD the url on the other tier and read the status. The server
 * that answers IS the authority on what it serves, which is a thing no table
 * can be. Both dev servers already send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, so
 * the cross-origin request is readable.
 *
 * DEV ONLY, and that is structural rather than promised: the sole caller sits
 * behind `import.meta.env.DEV`, so this function is unreachable — and tree-
 * shaken — in a production build. It must never become a runtime dependency of
 * anything a user loads.
 *
 * Failure is UNKNOWN, never false: if the other tier is not running, or the
 * fetch is blocked, the honest answer is "cannot tell", and the caller keeps
 * the pill live rather than greying out a destination that may be fine. A
 * control that disables itself because a probe failed is worse than one that
 * occasionally lands on a 404 you can see and read.
