/**
 * EPHEMERAL DOCK — a dev-only side column for page-specific instruments.
 *
 * The TRAY is what every page shares (tier pill, debug toggle). A page's own
 * panels — the offline map's memory/blobs/config rails — belong to one page
 * and are big, so they go in a dock instead. Empty dock, no dock: `:empty`
 * hides it, so a page that has not toggled its panels on shows nothing.
 *
 * THE BOX IS <SideCard>, not this file. Where a panel sits beside the phone
 * is one question with one answer — span the viewport edge to the frame, even
 * margins, measured from the frame's real box — and that answer used to live
 * here, gated behind `{#if dev}`. A public page needing the same geometry
 * therefore had to rewrite it, which is exactly what the wiki pages did and
 * got wrong. Escaping to <body> moved there too — a card that has not escaped
 * sits on top of the phone, so it is part of the box, not of the dev gate.
 * What stays here is genuinely dev-only: the gate, and the `bind:host` handle
 * a page uses to move its own nodes in.
